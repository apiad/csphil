# Philosophical Questions for Computer Scientists

> An introduction to philosophy for computer scientists.

## What is this?

An introductory ebook to select philosophical topics that are very relevant for computer scientists to explore. It is intended as a short introduction to several key philosophical ideas, including but not limited to, the nature of reality, the meaning of consciousness, the limitations of knowledge, as well as several ethical and moral questions.

The key difference with any other material I've read is that this content is designed from the ground up to be as interesting as possible for students and practitioners in the field of computer science. Thus, every topic is treated from a computational point of view, and paying especial attention to the implications it might have for the practice of computer science.

## But why?

Because philosophy is critically important for computer scientists, but there is hardly any relevant material that is accurate both in the computational and the philosophical domains, and is sufficiently engaging for STEM people.

As a professional computer scientist myself, I've struggled with introducing some philosophy in my technical classes, and I've found that, when properly engaged and challenged, CS students can have enjoy deep discussions on some of the most exciting and important philosophical issues. The problem they are hardly ever engaged and challenged. Often, the philosophy course for computer science is a dry, boring, and superficial discussion of historical events and figures.

What is lacking, of course, is a meaningful connection between those key philosophical ideas and the very real problems our students will face when practicing computer science, either in academia or the industry. This tiny book intends to fill that gap, to present some of the most relevant philosophical ideas and questions framed in a way that is both engaging and challenging for the computer scientist's mindset.

## How is this organized?

Ultimately, I intend this ebook to be formatted in two ways, as a online website, and as PDF/epub file.

The content is writen in Markdown with additional LaTeX formatting where necessary. There is a `makefile` that builds the content into the different formats (wip).

Regarding workflow, I follow a fairly simple model:

1. **Brainstorm**: in which I dump all possible ideas regarding a given topic, flat, on a Markdown file. Here quantity trumps quality, the purpose being covering as much ground as possible.

2. **Outline**: in which I select, reorder, and refine the ideas that came of the brainstorm. The end result is a structured outline with sections, subsections, and main claims.

3. **Content**: in which I expand every single claim in the outline to one, two, or as many paragraphs as necessary. Here again quantity trumps quality, the purpose being saying everything that can be said about each claim.

4. **Clarity**: in which I rewrite each paragraph, simplifying and cutting down all unnecessary stuff, to make the writing as clear as possible. Here almost all the text is rewriten.

5. **Polish**: in which I rewrite again, but this time just trying to pick the most important bits and make them as engaging as possible. Remove bland adjectives and make everything sound more vibrant.

To apply this workflow to a book, I use a two-level structure. At the top level we will have a [brainstorm.md file](md/brainstorm.md) where all top-level ideas coexist. This file will link to individual .md files that expand on a given idea, and which will ultimately become chapters.

The brainstorm file serves as an unstructured index to the rest of the content. It is not intended to be included in the final book, rather it is there to guide the writing process.

The individual chapter files will eventually become part of the book, once they graduate to phase 3 (content).

All contributions are greatly appreciated, whether it is fixing a typo, suggesting a topic, proof-reading, editing, brainstorming ideas, whatever.
